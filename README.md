# PEAKapalooza

**PEAKapalooza** contains a number of small to medium chooseable changes to the game, along with a couple larger "gamemodes"!

Any bugs can be put in the thread on the [PEAK modding discord](https://discord.gg/SAw86z24rB)

## Features

- Turn off Blizzards/Rain/Tornados!
- Make Tornados faster!
- Make Fog constantly approach (currently up to Caldera)!
- Abseiling (Peak->Beach) mode! Climb from the Peak to the Beach!

## How to Use

- Once in the Airport, open the Passport. There should be a button near the checkmark to go to the mod page.

For Abseiling (Peak->Beach) mode, upon start, wait until everyone is teleported to the Peak. This will take a moment.

## Installation
