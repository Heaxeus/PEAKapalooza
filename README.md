# PEAKapalooza

**PEAKapalooza** contains a number of small to medium mix-and-match changes to the game, along with a couple larger "gamemodes", like Peak to Beach!

Any bugs can be put in the thread on the [PEAK modding discord](https://discord.gg/SAw86z24rB)

The passport should have a "Next Page" button in the top right.

## Known Bugs

- Many of the generation options (Force Mesa, Force Alpine, etc.) are needing a complete rewrite to work due to recent game changes. For now, only "Alpine and Mesa Gen" works!

## Features

- Turn off Blizzards/Rain/Tornados!
- Make Tornados faster!
- Make Fog constantly approach (currently up to Caldera)!
- Peak To Beach mode! Climb from the Peak to the Beach! Your goal is to light a flare next to BingBong!
- And so much more!

## How to Use

- Once in the Airport, open the Passport. There should be a button near the checkmark to go to the mod page.

!! For Peak To Beach mode, upon start, wait until everyone is teleported to the Peak. This will take a moment. !!
