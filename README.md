# PEAKapalooza

**PEAKapalooza** contains a number of small to medium mix-and-match changes to the game, along with a couple larger "gamemodes"!

Any bugs can be put in the thread on the [PEAK modding discord](https://discord.gg/SAw86z24rB)

The passport should have a "Next Page" button in the top right.

## Known Bugs

- If doing multiple Peak To Beach runs in a row, you must fully close an relaunch Peak for them to work.
- Everyone joining in Peak to Beach mode must be in lobby when game starts. Joining into a running game will break things!

## Features

- Turn off Blizzards/Rain/Tornados!
- Make Tornados faster!
- Make Fog constantly approach (currently up to Caldera)!
- Peak To Beach mode! Climb from the Peak to the Beach! Your goal is to light a flare next to BingBong!
- And so much more!

## How to Use

- Once in the Airport, open the Passport. There should be a button near the checkmark to go to the mod page.

!! For Peak To Beach mode, upon start, wait until everyone is teleported to the Peak. This will take a moment. !!
